### A 10-Day Trip Across Vietnam:

After having made a few trips back to India to meet with family over the years, we decided to meet in a country other than India and the US. This year, we visited Vietnam and I can say without a doubt that this country is slept on. Everything from the people to the place and the culture is absolutely beautiful and you will be left with a lifetime's worth of memories.

#### Ho Chi Minh

We kicked off our trip in the southern city of Ho Chi Minh from where we would make travel north over the next 10 days before flying out of Hanoi. The city is so walkable and pedestrian friendly that I felt I was back in Mumbai. After checking in, I went about getting some sim cards and our cash exchanged while my family rested up. We spent the rest of the day exploring the city and it's markets before turning in for the night for the Mekong Delta Tour the next day.

#### Mekong River Delta:

The next day, we started and ended the day with the Mekong River Delta tour organized by [Saigon Hapy Tour](https://www.instagram.com/saigonhappytour/). As opposed to other tours, this felt less touristy and they made sure we got to experience the place just as the locals would with their garden walks, boat rides and scooter tours.

Our tour guide, Stag, was a delight and someone who I would gladly share a drink with sometime.

#### Hoi An:

After the tour, we flew to the bustling beach town of Hoi An. Here, the aim was to relax, catch up and enjoy everything the town and hotel had to offer from delicious food to stunning beaches and pleasantly chaotic markets. This leg of the journey also included a trip to the dense forests and theme parks of Ba Na Hills and the ancient Hindu temples in My Son Sanctuary. We scored all those beers you see below for free by the way, hehe.

#### Hanoi:

On to the capital city of Hoi An. It seemed like one of those cities which is an intricate maze where you are treated to a surprise at every turn and can feel the warmth in the people around you which makes up for the cold weather around. The chaotic train street, the endless coffee shops and the town's old quarters is the true personification of the term, method to the madness.

#### Ha Long Bay:

We then moved on to the quaint coastal town of Ha Long where we rested for a day and then boarded the ultra luxurious cruise to Ha Long Bay. For a moment it felt like we were deep in the terrain of another planet. We even got a chance to kayak through caves and take a dip in the water.

#### Ninh Binh:

For our last place on the trip, we travelled to the mesmerizing town of Ninh Binh, which is also known as Ha Long Bay on land. We boated through intricate river systems littered with ancient buddhist temples and views from the movie King Kong.

Vietnam was surprisingly beautiful and fun to travel through. While the primary goal was to meet up and spend time with family, I can confidently say that the country did not disappoint and I would recommend anyone thinking about taking a trip to South East Asia to keep Vietnam at the top of their list.
