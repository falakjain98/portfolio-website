### A Backpacking Trip to Lake Wenatchee

With temperatures close to freezing in Seattle, we decided that why not spend the weekend in some place even colder?! The plan was to drive out to Wenatchee Lake and hike up to Glacier View Campground to set up camp for the weekend. Everything was going well until we got to the parking lot. There was a snow covered way leading towards the campground. Being in a beefy AWD SUV, we decided to kick common sense to the curb and keep going by car as far as possible. This was the result:

After spending 4 hours trying to get the car out of the snow, we gave up and decided to carry on to the campground by foot while one of us stayed with the car and contacted roadside assistance. Those 4 hours included us shoveling over 3 ft of snow around the wheels, destroying a pair of traction pads and chains and even jacking the car up to get the traction pads underneath the wheels. Funnily enough, even the tow truck got stuck in the snow long before it could reach us. As a result, a crew had to come out with some specialized equipment the next day. For a video of how the car was finally towed out, here's a [video](https://youtu.be/j8LrMxW3mhw?si=4HgfVJ8-3U04Pgos).

After making it to the campground, we were greeted to beautiful views of Lake Wenatchee and the surrounding mountains. These pictures don't do justice to the place at all.

After enjoying the views, we set up camp and got cozy before the temperatures dropped to as low as 11 degrees in the night. A propane heater we carried on sleds, along with spicy Indian food came to the rescue here!

A Japanese lady accompanying us immensely enjoyed the Misal Pav and carried a pack back home with her as well. We spent the night talking, cooking mouth watering food, drinking hot cocoa and enjoying the beatiful starry skies.

The next morning, we packed up in the painful bone chilling temperatures after which we started the long walk back to our newly towed car waiting in the parking lot. This is me before we started heading out.

After an eventful weekend, we enjoyed some much needed cheat meals at the [59er Diner](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Rbm1nz449cKNZyTK6) on the way out before finally heading home and checking off another memorable backpacking trip.
