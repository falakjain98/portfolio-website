### A Trip to Paulsbo and Baindrige Island

Spent the Sunday with friends on a little road trip to the quaint, picturesque towns of Paulsbo and Bainbridge Island. Paulsbo is also known as Little Norway but I don't think we knew that before we got there :(.

While the plan was to see the best of what both places have to offer, it just ended up as a day of bar hopping and hanging out with friends. No complaints there!

I grabbed some Jalapeno Cheddar bread from Sluys Paulsbo Bakery after we waited in line for 40 mins! The bread was worth the wait though.

After Paulsbo we headed to Bainbridge and planned on a place for brunch first. Brunch turned into a 2 hour long feast which finally ended with us at the wine tasting room right across the street.

A wonderful mango mimosa:

A delicious chilli for lunch:

Wine tasting right after lunch (I poured for all the 10 of us!):

We ended the day with some ice cream and finally headed back to the city.

Toffee Coffee and Salted Caramel scoops (a lot of people complemented the gloves btw):
