  <h1>Hi there!</h1>
  <p>
    Welcome to my personal website! Here, you can explore my projects, read my
    blog, and learn more about my journey.
  </p>

  <p>
    Passionate about bridging the gap between technology and business impact, I
    thrive at the intersection of analytics, innovation, and strategy. I'm eager
    to leverage my experience and technical acumen to empower teams, and create
    scalable, impactful solutions in dynamic environments.
  </p>

  <p>
    Work and academics aside, I enjoy swimming, tennis, biking, hiking and
    camping and am a PADI certified diver as well as an active reader. From
    being knee deep in snow at 15,000 ft to 60ft deep in the ocean, I like
    living life to the fullest and strongly believe that it is better lived when
    you have people around to share such experiences with. I enjoy meeting new
    people, learning from their life experiences and making meaningful
    connections.
